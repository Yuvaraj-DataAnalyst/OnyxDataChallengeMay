Hey there! 👋  
This project is my take on visualizing mobile phone sales in a clean, interactive, and story-driven way — all built with the magic of **Power BI**.  
It's not just charts. It’s insights with a personality. 🎯

## 🔍 What’s in the Dashboard?

- 📊 Sales performance by **brand**, **city**, and **month**
- 🚀 Dynamic KPIs like **Total Sales**, **Units Sold**, and **Avg. Price**
- 🧠 **Interactive slicers** to explore the data how you want
- 🧩 Designed with clarity and simplicity in mind (with a bit of fun!)
